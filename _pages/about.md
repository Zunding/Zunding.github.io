Hi! Currently Iâ€™m a second year Ph.D. student majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Bo Li](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~bli/). My research interests include optimization, scientific computing, machine learning, and their applications in biology and finance. Right now I am interested in minimizing Legendre Transform of electrostatic free-energy functional with VISM. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information and Computational Sciences in [School of Mathematical Science, University of Science and Technology of China](https://math.ustc.edu.cn/).

My email address is zuhuang at ucsd.edu.

My Chinese name is <img src='/images/Huang.png'><img src='/images/Zun.png'><img src='/images/Ding.png'>
