Hi! I completed my Ph.D. in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego, where I was advised by Professor [Bo Li](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~bli/). My research interests include optimization, numerical PDEs, and machine learning. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Information and Computational Sciences from the School of Mathematical Science at USTC.

I joined Wells Fargoâ€™s Quantitative Analytics Program as a summer intern in 2024 and returned as a full-time associate in 2025.

My email address is zundinghuang at gmail.com.
