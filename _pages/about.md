Hi! Currently Iâ€™m a fourth year Ph.D. student majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Bo Li](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~bli/). My research interests include optimization, numerical analysis, deep learning and their applications in biology, especially in electrostatics. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information and Computational Sciences in School of Mathematical Science, USTC. 

I was the organizer of the Machine Learning Seminar in Math department at UCSD for the 2023 Fall quarter.

I joined Quantitative Analytics Internship Program in Market Risk Analytics team at Wells Fargo in Summer 2024.
