Hi! Currently I’m a fifth year Ph.D. student majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My advisor is Professor [Bo Li](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~bli/). My research interests include optimization, numerical PDE, and machine learning. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Information and Computational Sciences in School of Mathematical Science, USTC.

I joined Wells Fargo’s Quantitative Analytics Program as a summer intern in 2024 and returned as a full-time associate in 2025.

My email address is zundinghuang at gmail.com.

My Chinese name is <img src='/images/Huang.png'><img src='/images/Zun.png'><img src='/images/Ding.png'>
