A Note of Legendre Transforms of Electrostatic Free-Energy Functionals
======
Minimizing Legendre Transforms of Electrostatic Free-Energy Functionals instead of PB Free-Energy Functional is a very interesting topic in computational biology. [Here](https://Zunding.github.io/files/CiottiLi_LegendreTransforms_SIAP2018.pdf) is the note of theoretical proof of the equivalence between them.

Financial Issues
======
Previously, I used machine learning, especially LSTM to predict of S&P 500 index in 2019. [Here](https://github.com/Zunding/S-P-500-Index-Prediction) are the code and details for the work. I planned to write a paper this year with the work.

Also, I attended CQA financial competition in the second year of my Ph.D. and we made the second turn of the competition.

My favourite game
======
I am a crazy fan of League of Legends. My best heros are [Jayce](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Jayce), [Ezreal](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Ezreal), [Lucian](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Lucian), [Jhin](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Jhin) and [Kaisa](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Kai%27Sa/LoL). Specifically, my English name is from the “Jayce” champion.
